# MultiverseOfColonization

## Project Title: "MultiverseOfColonization : India's Colonization on Britain"

**Concept and Implementation:**

This GSAP animation project, titled "MultiverseOfColonization," explores a speculative scenario where India colonized Britain. The concept delves into an alternate history, compressing three centuries of rule into an engaging and visually compelling animation using GSAP's ScrollTrigger plugin.

**Description:**

The project begins with showcasing the Maps of two Countries, Major events are taken to describe a basic alternate history where event and characters are animated seamlessly as users scroll through the webpage, offering a dynamic and immersive storytelling experience.

**Implementation:**

The animation is powered by GSAP, a JavaScript animation library, with a focus on ScrollTrigger for scroll-driven animations. The library plays a vital role in implementing smooth transitions, synchronized with user scrolling. The animations include the unveiling of maps, the rise of revolutions, and the emergence of significant events and **The INDEPENDENCE**. 

**Resources and Credits:**

SVG: The project relies on various SVG images, and maps. All SVG's were hand drawn, besides the Map of UK and India. The resources are provided at the end of this document

Co-pilot Assistance: During the development process, OpenAI's Code completion tool (Co-pilot) was utilized to overcome coding challenges and generate snippets efficiently.

**Known Glitches:**

While the project is mostly smooth and visually engaging, there are still a few glitches observed during scrolling. Occasionally, the animation speed may unexpectedly increase, impacting the overall user experience. These glitches are being actively addressed, and future updates will aim to enhance the website's performance.

**Evaluation:**

GSAP and ScrollTrigger proved to be powerful tools for creating intricate scroll-driven animations. The library's documentation is extensive and is failry new, making it accessible for advanced users, but difficult for beginners. It wasn't completely worse choosing the ScrollTrigger but was a learning point along with some frustrating moments.
